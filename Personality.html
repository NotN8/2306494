        <p>If there were one hobby that I'd have to consider as the most powerful I've done, it would have to be hiking.
             Hiking has me very intrigued due to its alluring nature and It's motivated me in more ways than I can count. 
             One of said ways is that it propels me to work harder to become financially free through my passion in 
             computing. This would further enable me to pursue more powerful, yet lighthearted endeavors that may 
             continue to stabilize my mental and prep me for any challenge in my academic/career journey.</p>

            <h3>Vital Trait&#128170</h3>
            <p>
                As for a vital trait, I do consider myself to be a tolerant individual. I'm not very sure how I could express that, 
                but to put it simply, I don't think I could be here doing this assignment if that trait weren't present. From the many 
                trials we face on a day to day as humans, some bigger than others, for one to remain steadfast in the pursuit of their goals,
                 they must practice some form of forbearance. And if there is one thing that I'm humbly grateful for, is that I've held on to 
                 that trait even when it was common sense to drop it.

            <h3>My Hero&#129328</h3>
            <p>
                They've held my hand when I was young, they've picked me up whenever I was down, they've nursed me through sickness, 
                nurtured me through painful times and most of all, loved me when it was most difficult to do so. My hero is none other than my mother, 
                it's difficult to put what she's done for me in brief words, but if I were to do so, those words would be: Guidance, Protection, Patience, 
                Sacrifice and LOVE. There will never be another hero who takes precedence over my first lady.

            <h3>Opinion on the Test</h3>
            <p>
                I do believe that this test has some validity to it because I've tried to be 100% truthful with my answers. 
                I'm not a firm believer in these tests due to the nature of people and the notion that you can manipulate the 
                results by giving the “right answers”.
