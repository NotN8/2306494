                I'm currently a second year pursuing a Bachelors in Computing, with a specialization in Computer Science.
                I've developed and improved many skills, but the most substanstial improvement has been in my problem solving
                skills and my interpretation.

                <h3>Chapter 4 Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Chapter 4 made mention on the incrementation to achieving goals. It also hints that though you might 
                    not currently be where you want to be in life, it's never too late to get started on the journey to 
                    where you want to get to.  It also referred to the fact that, most of the time the goals you set aren't 
                    all that important, it's what you had to go through and accomplish to achieve said goal, that has meaning. 
                    It also mentioned that even after accomplishing a goal, the work is not necessarily over, those goals may require 
                    maintenance.<br>
                </p>
                    <h3>My Take</h3>
                <p>The author made great points that I need to incorporate into my daily thoughts and actions. If there were at least one 
                    thing I'd like to immediately adopt is the notion he mentioned, it was that it isn't all about the destination and that 
                    I should appreciate the journey for it is the more fruitful outcome.

                <h3>Chapter 5 Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Chapter 5 focused on the utilization of time, it hints at the fact that many may not have goals/dreams, and even if they do 
                    their too fearful to act on reaching said dream. In turn, leading us to bear the feeling of regret when it is too late to act. 
                    The chapter encourages us to spend our hours on the opportunities that align with our goals rather than throwing our time away on urgent 
                    tasks that mean nothing in the grand scheme.
                </p>
                <h3>My Take</h3>
                <p>
                    Once again, some eye-opening points made that I'm grateful to have read. Personally, I do tend to squander a lot of my time towards 
                    pointless endeavors in which I will do my best to address.

                <h3>Chapter 6 Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Chapter 6 addresses the company you have within your life, are they propelling you forward, or drawing you back? It says if you truly want to become successful, 
                    you must surround yourself with successful people. They recommend starting with categorizing your peers into 3 groups: Disassociation, Limited association and 
                    expanded association and allocate time as such. They also stated that to discover these beneficial relationships, one must become what you are attracted to hence 
                    the quote “To attract attractive people you must be attractive”. Who you associate with affects your attitude, and your attitude affects everything you do.<br>
                </p>
                    <h3>My Take</h3>
                <p>This of all the chapters has resonated with me the most because there has been a point in my life already, where I had realized this principle to be true. 
                    Sadly, at the time, I had no full proof methods of going about this realization and handled it poorly, so seeing this is really refreshing.

                <h3>Chapter 7 Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Chapter 7 emphasizes that a successful individual must be a lifelong learner. They argued that formal education is not the end of the road for knowledge, 
                    you must constantly feed that hunger for information through self-education.  This can be done via many means, through observation, material such as books, 
                    introspection. 
                </p>
                <h3>My Take</h3>
                <p>
                    Could not have agreed more and I will strive to continue to implement this attitude.
